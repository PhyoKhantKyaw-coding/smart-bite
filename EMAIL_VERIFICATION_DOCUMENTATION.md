## Backend Requirements

Your backend should:

1. **Send OTP Email** when user signs up
2. **Validate OTP** when `/VerifyEmail` is called
3. **Resend OTP** when `/ResetOTP` is called
4. **Update Password** when `/forget-password` is called
5. Return proper response structure:
   ```json
   {
     "status": 0,  // 0 = success, 1 = error
     "message": "Success message",
     "data": true/false
   }
   ```

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ OTP should expire after a certain time
- ‚úÖ Limit OTP resend attempts
- ‚úÖ Validate email format
- ‚úÖ Enforce password strength requirements
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on password reset
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider adding email verification for password reset (send OTP before allowing reset)
